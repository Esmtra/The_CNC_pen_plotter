# The_CNC_pen_plotter
 The CNC pen plotter project was completed for a mechatronics system design course as both an open-loop and closed-loop control system.  It utilized various software such as UGS, Inkscape, GRBL, Arduino ID, Produtos, and MATLAB,  as well as hardware including an Arduino, stepper driver, CNC shield, metal VGroove bearing kit, servo motor, 3D printed parts, C-Beam linear rail, stepper motor (NEMA17), GT2-6mm open timing belt, GT2 bore 5mm and 6mm 20 teeth timing aluminum, 2 DC motors 30kw, and 2 encoder 1000 ppr.
